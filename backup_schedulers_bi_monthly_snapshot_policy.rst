Bi-monthly Backup Policy
========================

Introduction
------------

This policy creates a remote snapshot every two months and retains them for up to 6 months, ensuring a balance
between storage conservation and restore availability.

Scheduler Configuration
-----------------------

- **Snapshot Frequency**: Every two months on the 1st day at 17:00 UTC
- **Months**: February, April, June, August, October, December
- **Retention Rule**: Keep all snapshots for the last 6 months
- **Time Window**: The backup window runs daily from 07:00 to 19:00 UTC.
  This policy only uses it to scope execution.

Snapshot Timeline (1 Year)
--------------------------

Letâ€™s break it down over one calendar year:

- Snapshots are taken on:
  - Feb 1, Apr 1, Jun 1, Aug 1, Oct 1, Dec 1

- At any given time, up to 3 most recent snapshots will be retained, due to the 6-month retention rule.
  - Example: In July, only Feb 1, Apr 1, and Jun 1 snapshots remain.

**Total retained snapshots after 1 year**:

::

  3 snapshots. Snapshots older than 6 months are automatically deleted.
