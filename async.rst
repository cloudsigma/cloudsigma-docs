Asynchronous server

Authentication
--------------

To use the asynchronous server, you must first authenticate through the API. This will give you a cookie that is valid for 2 minutes and that has to be used when connecting to the server.

:statuscode 200: no error

**Example request**:

.. sourcecode:: http

  POST /2.0/accounts/action/?do=authenticate_asynchronous HTTP/1.1
  Host: api.cloudsigma.com
  Accept: application/json
  Authorization: Basic dGVzdHVzZXJAY2xvdWRzaWdtYS5jb206dmJudmJu

Using this cookie will allow you to connect to the server at /2.0/websocket


Information
-----------

The websocket server sends frames every time one of the following changes:

    * :doc:`subscriptions`
    * :doc:`drives`
    * :doc:`servers`
    * :doc:`networking`
    * :ref:`balance`
    * :doc:`profile`
    * :doc:`jobs`


The frame is a JSON object that contains the following fields:
    * resource_type: A text field that describes the type of resource covered by the notification.
    * resource_uri: The URI of the resource that has changed.

The JSON object might contain an 'object' key, that will contain the full-blown resource referenced by the notification, JSON encoded.
